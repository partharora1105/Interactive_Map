            <h3>Historical context</h3><br><i>A Crack in Space</i> is an essay commenting on the temporary and transitional nature of the Hong Kong region’s existence and state of being along with the idea of the 'crisis of calm' in which Hong Kong is holding onto their culture and traditions very tightly and progress is slow. The text talks about the threats and opportunities of Hong Kong’s future with the metaphor of the train, the space and the crack.<br><i>A Short History of our Shores</i> personifies Hong Kong in a unique format in which she discusses the events of Hong Kong and reflects on her emotional ties to Hong Kong. She also writes about her story of belonging and not belonging to the people and home city of Hong Kong.<br><br> <h3>Importance of Adapting these texts</h3><br>It is important to adapt the text because it explores the nuances of Hong Kong’s culture and the conflict in how they identify themselves. Through adaptation, we can further understand the current politics of Hong Kong. Hong Kong has also been a country who has struggled with individuality, as international mainstream media has made it difficult to explore Hong Kong’s true culture and identity. As a result, it is important to adapt these texts in a way that shares Hong Kong’s story from an inner perspective rather than the perspective of major outside media influences.<br> <br> <h3>Ethics of adaptation</h3><br>The adaptation will consider the ethics of representation by researching primary sources to understand the personal stories within the larger context of conflict in Hong Kong. Through the primary sources, we will attempt to refrain from passing our own biases so that the stories of the individuals with direct connection can be told.<br> <br><h3>Justification for Medium</h3><br>The design will incorporate trains and train stops and at each stop there will be historical context along with a ‘wall’ of sticky notes that give a story as the person clicks through. This medium is appropriate because it goes from the broad ideas of Hong Kong to the narrow story of a person with a full, fleshed out image by the time the reader reaches the end with a dose of historical context at each train stop.

            Xu Xi is an Indonesian Chinese raised in Hong Kong. She speaks English and Chinese, even though those languages are not her parents' native languages. Her father traded manganese ore and her mother was a pharmacist. Xu started writing stories in English when she was a child. As an adult, she maintained a parallel career in international marketing for 18 years, working for several major multinationals, while writing and publishing fiction. She left corporate life in 1998.

She previously held Indonesian nationality.

Xu Xi is a graduate of the MFA Program for Poets & Writers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Now a U.S. citizen, she was on the low-residency MFA fiction and creative nonfiction faculty at Vermont College in Montpelier from 2002 to 2012; she was elected and served as faculty chair from 2009 to 2012.

In 2010, she became writer-in-residence at the Department of English, City University of Hong Kong, where she established and directs the first, low-residency Master of Fine Arts (MFA) programme to specialise in Asian writing in English.

In 2015, the university's decision to close the programme, at a time when freedoms in Hong Kong were felt to be under threat, drew criticism locally and from the international writing establishment.

Xu Xi is based between Hong Kong, where she works, and New York, where her life partner lives.
